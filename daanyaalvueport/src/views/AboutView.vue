              HEY!! I'm Daanyaal Kellerman. I'm an aspiring Fullstack Web
              Developer. I enjoy bringing out the creative talent of other's and
              distributing the knowledge that i learn along my journey. I tend
              to make those around me more comfortable to better their mindset,
              lessen stress within the work environment and to strengthen our
              bonds.<br />
              When it comes to doing things under pressure i always think of
              that one bruce lee quote "flow like water" so i go with the flow
              whilst still maintaining my drive towards the unreachable goal
              that is Perfection. <br />
              I spend most of my time skating to be more active, gyming to
              better my physical health, playing games to meet new people and
              spending quality time with my family.
